\section*{Abstract}
\textit{The internet as global communication platform evolved to a pillar of modern society. Increasing demand to exchange data keeps putting a fundamental question to internet service providers: How to fulfil the consumers requests? When expanding communication networks one can either establish and connect networks, which means being forced to install new cables and expensive hardware, or adapt the network to utilize existing devices and lines more efficiently.}

\textit{This is where the aspect of optimizing networks comes to mind. In this paper we will detail how to model the real world problem of assigning wavelengths to communication lines in fibre networks relying on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) using the Partition Graph Coloring Problem (PCP) and present a solution using metaheuristic approaches, namely a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS).}
